This is a repository for a few introductory files using latex.  

On Debian/Ubuntu you can install LaTeX with:

#apt-get install texlive-full

After that you can take any LaTeX file (usually ends with `.tex`) and at the
command line:

$pdflatex filename.tex

A beautiful pdf will be produced.  This repository provides `sample.tex`
to get you started.  

I believe the best reference for learning LaTeX (without packages) is the
"Not so short guide to LaTeX2e" and is found here:

https://tobi.oetiker.ch/lshort/lshort.pdf

Generally, it's not a good idea to try to learn latex.  I find it's better to
think of what you want to write and use the guide to type out your document.
